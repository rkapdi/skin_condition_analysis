**Objective**: To develop a deep learning model that accurately identifies, classifies, and provides insights on common facial skin conditions.

#### **Targeted Facial Conditions**:

1. **Acne**:
    
    - **Papules**: Small, red, raised bumps caused by inflamed or infected hair follicles.
    - **Pustules**: Small red pimples that have pus at their tips.
    - **Nodules**: Solid, often painful lumps beneath the surface of the skin.
    - **Cysts**: Large, pus-filled lumps that look similar to boils.
2. **Blackheads (Open Comedones)**:
    
    - Small, dark lesions that appear on the skin, often on the face and neck. They are a feature of mild acne but can appear without other signs of acne.
3. **Whiteheads (Closed Comedones)**:
    
    - Very similar to blackheads but can be firmer and won't empty when squeezed.
4. **Hyperpigmentation**:
    
    - **Melasma**: Often due to hormonal changes and is identified by brown to gray-brown patches on the face.
    - **Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation**: Dark spots that develop after an acne breakout, pimple, or other skin injuries.
5. **Wrinkles**:
    
    - **Fine Lines**: Early wrinkles that are just starting to appear.
    - **Deep Wrinkles**: More visible and harder to treat with over-the-counter products alone.
    - **Dynamic Wrinkles**: Form from repetitive facial movements like smiling or frowning.
6. **Rosacea**:
    
    - A condition that causes the face to become red and can produce small, red, pus-filled bumps.
7. **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)**:
    
    - Can cause the skin on the face to become itchy and inflamed.
8. **Sun Damage**:
    
    - **Solar Lentigines (Sun Spots or Age Spots)**: Small, darkened patches on the skin.
    - **Photoaging**: Premature aging of the skin caused by repeated exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
9. **Under-eye Circles**:
    
    - Can be blueish, brownish, or reddish, and may be due to aging, eye strain, or lifestyle factors.
10. **Texture Irregularities**:
    
    - **Rough patches**: Caused by dryness or skin conditions like psoriasis.
    - **Uneven skin**: Due to enlarged pores, acne scars, or other scars.
11. **Dehydration**:
    
    - Dullness, dark under-eye circles, appearance of more wrinkles, and sunken eyes are signs of skin dehydration.

The model should not only detect and classify these conditions but also provide severity scores or stages if applicable. This allows users to not only be aware of their skin conditions but also to monitor them over time to see if they're improving or deteriorating, aiding in personal skincare regimen decisions.
