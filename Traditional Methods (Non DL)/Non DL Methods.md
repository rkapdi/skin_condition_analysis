These systems rely on hand-crafted rules rather than learned patterns.

- **How it works**: Expert dermatologists create a series of if-else rules based on observed patterns in skin conditions. For example, if a lesion is asymmetric and has a diameter larger than 6mm, it might be flagged as potentially malignant.
- **Advantages**: Transparent and interpretable; no need for extensive datasets.
- **Limitations**: Might not capture the complexity and variety of all skin conditions; maintaining and updating the rules can be labor-intensive.

### 2. **Texture Analysis**:

This technique focuses on analyzing the texture of skin lesions or conditions.

- **How it works**: Extracts texture features such as entropy, energy, contrast, and correlation from the image. Techniques such as Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) or Local Binary Pattern (LBP) can be used.
- **Advantages**: Can be useful for distinguishing between different skin conditions based on their surface patterns.
- **Limitations**: Texture alone might not capture all the nuances of a skin condition.

### 3. **Color Analysis**:

Skin conditions can often be characterized by their color.

- **How it works**: Segment the image into regions based on color and analyze the distribution and concentration of these colors. Histogram-based methods or clustering like K-means can be employed.
- **Advantages**: Some conditions have characteristic colors that make them distinguishable.
- **Limitations**: Skin conditions might appear differently colored under different lighting conditions.

### 4. **Traditional Image Processing Techniques**:

Before deep learning became dominant, traditional image processing methods were widely used.

- **How it works**: Techniques like edge detection, contour extraction, segmentation, and morphological operations can be applied to extract features or highlight certain aspects of skin conditions.
- **Advantages**: No need for training; deterministic results.
- **Limitations**: Might not achieve the same level of accuracy as deep learning methods.

### 5. **Dermoscopic Criteria Analysis**:

Dermoscopy is a non-invasive method that uses a magnifying lens and a light source to examine skin lesions.

- **How it works**: It looks for specific dermoscopic criteria linked to various skin conditions. Algorithms can be developed to identify these criteria automatically.
- **Advantages**: Can detect features that are not visible to the naked eye.
- **Limitations**: Requires dermoscopic images, which are not as commonly available as standard photographs.

### 6. **Hybrid Approaches**:

Combining multiple techniques can sometimes yield better results.

- **How it works**: Features extracted from traditional methods can be combined with deep learning models. For example, texture and color features can be used alongside deep features for classification.
- **Advantages**: Taps into the strengths of multiple methods.
- **Limitations**: Might increase the complexity of the system.

### 7. **Clinical History and Meta Data Analysis**:

Sometimes, contextual information can be as revealing as the image itself.

- **How it works**: Combine image analysis with patient's clinical history, age, gender, and other metadata. Algorithms can be developed to factor in these inputs along with image data.
- **Advantages**: Provides a holistic view and can improve diagnosis accuracy.
- **Limitations**: Requires access to detailed and accurate patient data.

When choosing or designing an approach, it's crucial to consider the application's goals, available resources, and constraints. Often, a combination of methods tailored to the specific needs of the problem can yield the best results.
